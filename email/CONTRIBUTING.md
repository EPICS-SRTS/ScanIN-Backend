If you wish to help us improve the codebase, add some features or provide a translation to your native language, make sure you have the most recent code downloaded [as described here](https://github.com/afterlogic/webmail-lite-8#installation-instructions) as the process differs from installing the latest stable version. 

In WebMail Lite 8 [Developer's Guide](https://afterlogic.com/docs/webmail-lite-8/developers-guide) you can find a number of tutorials for extending the product functionality and integrating it with other applications, as well as documentation for [Web API](https://afterlogic.com/webmail-lite-8-webapi/) and [PHP API](https://afterlogic.com/webmail-lite-8-api/).

Upon making changes to WebMail Lite 8 code, you can send us a Pull Request. Please bear in mind that the product has a modular structure, so you'll need to send a Pull Request in each repository where you made any changes.

Also, you can create a module for our product, and you might wish to use one of the existing modules as a ground. You can upload it to your own repository of course. And if you believe other users of WebMail Lite 8 could benefit from such a module, please [let us know](https://afterlogic.com/contact) about it!
